## Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT — to demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

---

## AI Tools Required
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Any text editor or command-line interface
- Optional: Integration tools for memory or task management

---

## Explanation
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can act as intelligent personal assistants when provided with well-designed prompts.  
This experiment focuses on designing such a **personal productivity assistant** capable of managing daily activities, scheduling reminders, suggesting wellness tips, and adapting to user preferences over time.

---

## Prompt
> “Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time.”

---

## Procedure
1. Define the core requirements of a **personal productivity assistant**.  
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT.  
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.  
4. Collect feedback or user inputs and adapt responses accordingly.  
5. *(Optional)* Integrate basic memory or context retention to simulate preference adaptation.

## Example Applications
You can experiment with similar prompt-based ideas such as:
- **Study Time Scheduler**  
- **Project Task Breakdown Assistant**  
- **Personal Budget Manager**  
- **Travel Itinerary Planner**

---

## Expected Output
**Example Response by LLM:**

### Personal Productivity Assistant – Key Features

**1. Daily Task Manager**
- Accepts tasks via natural language (e.g., “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM”).  
- Organizes tasks by priority and deadline.  
- Provides daily summaries and pending task lists.  

**2. Smart Scheduler**
- Schedules events and sets reminders using contextual understanding.  
- Notifies the user of overlapping appointments or available free time slots.  

**3. Wellness Tips Generator**
- Suggests daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).  
- Adapts suggestions based on previous preferences and responses.  

---

## Result
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a **personal assistant powered by Large Language Models**.  
Students were able to:

- Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.  
- Foster creativity by designing features suited to personal or academic lives.  
- Learn **prompt engineering** techniques for optimal AI interaction.  
- Experience the versatility and utility of **generative AI** in solving everyday problems.
